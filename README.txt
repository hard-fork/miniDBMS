Read the files carefully!
If you are using Mac, Linux, you can compile the code by just type 'make' in the code folder at the terminal.
if you are using Mac, there may be something wrong with the data stored location, because IOS may not using the relative path location.

For this homework, you can just us VS(Visual Studio) to run, debug your code.
